# Beef Consomm√© Rice

*side dish, crowd pleaser*

**4 Servings**

---

- 1 can Campbell's Beef Consomme soup
- 1 cup rice
- 1 Yellow Onion
- 1/2 stick of butter
- a large sauce pan or shallow pot with lid, **oven safe**

1. Chop or dice the onion
2. Over medium heat, melt the butter til clear
3. Add all the onion to the pan, stirring to coat with butter
4. Preheat oven to 375
5. Pour soup into a measuring cup, then add water to get the volume per rice package instructions
   - the Jasmine rice I use calls for 1 1/2 cups of water for 1 cup of rice.
6. Saute until the onions are carmelized, stirring occasionally
   - Optional, saute the rice with the onions once the onions are done, 3-4 minutes.
7. Add rice and liquids, cover.  Bake at 375 for 1 hour.
8. Remove from oven, stir, allow it to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
   - The pot will be 300 degrees for several minutes after it leaves the oven. Wear oven mits
   - Add pot handle covers where possible to save you and your guests from yourselves.

I use jasmine rice, but any non-instant rice works.  
You can swap out the yellow onion for white onion or vidalia onion.  Whatever's handy.  
Tips for scaling this recipe:  
- Scale the rice up following the directions on the package for water.  Swap a can of soup for a cup of water, maintaining about half & half.
- Butter & onion doesn't need to double at the same rate as the rice.  There's lots of latitude here, and it's hard to carmelize 4 onions in 2 sticks of butter in one pan.  You'll get great results with 4 cups of rice, a stick of butter & 2 onions.
- Don't expect leftovers if there's a crowd around.
